# Private Folder 

This directory is ignored, and files will not get added to the repo if they are in this directory. 

Keep any users specific files in here, so they don't end up in your repo: 

Examples: 

* hunspell_en_all 
* my_api_keys 
* private-aliases 
* world-dominations-plan 
* ssh_config
