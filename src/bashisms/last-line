## Check and source the bash completion file if it exists ##

# The following line checks whether a file named 'complete_alias' exists
# in the directory '/etc/bash_completion.d/'. This directory usually
# contains shell script files that provide completion functions for bash.
# The '-f' option is used with 'if' to test if the specified file exists
# and is a regular file.
